Closed Network Routing Table
=============================

In this project I will implement a router's routing table that will use the NAT protocol in order to derease the number of IP addresses that it uses to communicate with each end. 

## TODO

Implememnt Ethernet frames in order to handle raw headers.

Implement ARP packets to be able to search the network for a given node.

Implement IPv4 packets to transfer informetion securely over the network.

Handle select ICMP packets that will send control information between endpoints.

Implement the routing table that will keep track of communications.
